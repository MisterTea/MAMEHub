 [R. Belmont]

 * Brought initial Maria cycle counts inline from measurements taken
    with logic analyzer/tests. [Mike Saarna/Robert Tuccitto]
 * Added interrupts to DMA cycle eating. Updates to LL, OL, and spin
    accounting for HALT behavior. [Mike Saarna]

-kb3600: More sensible multi-key handling, now actually behaves
 like h/w.  [R. Belmont]

 * Moved the msx slot layouts to inline machine configuration.
 * Started adding support for a few more firmware types.
 * Add turbo support to Panasonic FS-A1FX/FS-A1WX/FS-A1WSX.

-Amiga: Implement internal IDE controller for the Amiga 4000. Fix RTC
 hookup in Amiga 3000 and 4000. Set RP5C01 RTC to actually return 24
 hour mode, which fixes RTC detection for the Amiga. [Dirk Best]

-amigafdc: Add writing [O. Galibert]

-Amiga: Kill the legacy CIA emulation and fix Agnus ID for A2000 and A500. [Dirk Best]
 CIA changes:
 * Add missing virtual keyword to actually call the right TOD clock
 * Outputs depend on the input state (fixes A1000 overlay switch)
 * Switching to serial output mode with one-shot activated causes a
    pulse on SP (correct? needed for keyboard handshake)
 * Serial input is clocked by the CNT input, not the default clock
 * Mask offsets to 4 bits
 * Writing the Timer High register with one-shot activated immediately
    causes the timer to be latched and the timer started, regardless
    of timer start value

-at: added preliminary ATi Graphics Ultra Pro (mach32) ISA video card.
 [Barry Rodewald]

-fmtowns: added clone FM Towns II FreshTV [caius, Barry Rodewald]

-Amiga: Support PAL/NTSC switch for machines equipped with an ECS Agnus
 chip or better. [Dirk Best]

 Core changes:
 * Save screen pixelclock.
 * Call reset_partial_updates() in finish_screen_updates() instead of
    creating an extra timer for it. This prevents calling
    reset_partial_updates() after finishing the screen, causes issues
    when screens change their size to a size lower than the current
    screen.
 * Optimization: Support calling vblank_begin() directly at the start
   of a frame instead of using a timer.

-Amiga: Add version 6.1 bootroms for the A590/A2091 and RAM controller PAL [Guru]

-sun3: Work in progress on Sun 3/80.  It now POSTs.  [R. Belmont]

-c8050: Added ROM signatures for 901483-04.
 [Paul Rickards, Mike Naberezny]

-x68k: compose the gfx and sprite/bg layers individually before drawing
 to the screen [Carl]

-exelv.c [Gilles Fétis] 
  Improved emulation in driver to the
  point where exl100 will successfully load and execute cartridges. 
  Still lacking any input at the moment.

-nes.c: fixed WRAM banking for MMC5, so that Bandit Kings of
 Ancient China (and Suikoden - Tenmei no Chikai) can be considered as
 working. Also fixed wrong battery size for Aoki Ookami to Shiroki
 Mejika - Genchou Hishi in xml, which was causing a "Memory Over" error
 message ingame. [Fabio Priuli]

-msx.c: Added support for mapper used by Holy Quran.
 [hap, Wilbert Pol]

-ql: Added slot interfaces for the expansion and ROM cartridge
 ports. Modernized the Sandy Super Disk, Sandy SuperQBoard, and Miracle
 Trump Card floppy interfaces. Added a device for the QIMI (not working
 yet). Created skeletons for several expansion cards. [Curt Coder]

-rainbow.c: New floppy code - uses more reliable 'wd_fdc'. [Bavarese]

-ql: Added preliminary CST Q+4 emulation. [Curt Coder]

-gb.c: Added GameBoy Pocket Boot ROM. [BennVenn]

-vtech1: Add "VZ-200 Enhanced BASIC V1.01" [Chicken Man]

-Apollo updates [Hans Ostermeyer]
 * Fixed ISA bus endianness, it's the same as other 680x0 systems with
    ISA
 * Improved logging in several places
 * "20 years ago" option updated to now-necessary "25 years ago"
 * Fixed ISA high IRQ routing
 * Fixed 3c505 to have a 16 bit ISA interface
 * Fixed omti8621 and sc499 to have correct-endian ISA interfaces

-hprot1:  [Felipe Sanches]
 * new derivative "CARD I PCB rev.08A"
 * new derivative "CARD II PCB rev.6"
 * fixed LCD rendering (now both lines are displayed properly)
 * inverted logic of the inputs so that now we can navigate the menu

-mac: fix 0.153 regression that prevented several Macs from
booting. [R. Belmont]

-apple2: Support some oddball sized disk images and DOS 3.3
 disks that were ripped in ProDOS sector order. [R. Belmont]

-sms.c: Several timing fixes:  [Enik Land]
 * Fix flicker on Choplifter title screen by drawing the borders
    through timers.
 * Instead trigger NMI at end of the display, do it at end of top
    border (line 261 after start of active screen area).
 * Add a delay to NMI, to be later than HINT, as stated by Flubba's
    VDPTest readme.
 * Also based on VDPTest readme, change VINT and Sprite Overflow flags
    to be later than VCount change.
 * Delay a little the display callback, to fix the title scrolling of
    Road Rash (SMS game).
 * Fixed documentation of the scanline sections and change some
    timings to match.
 * Calculate initial VCount values, instead use of hardcoded values.

-wswan.c: Added noise emulation  [trap15, Wilbert Pol]

-mac: add PMU ROMs for later use [R. Belmont]

-gameboy: Added support for Li Cheng pirate mapper.
 [taizou, Fabio Priuli]

-osdcore: Allow "default" for -midiin and -midiout. [R. Belmont]

-Apple II: Support for the Mountain Computer Music System.
 [R. Belmont]

-apple II: support Decillionix DX-1 sampler card. [R. Belmont]

-c64: Precalculate PLA outputs for approximately 5% speedup.
 [Curt Coder]

-vz300 floppy: Initial modern implementation [O. Galibert]

-Apple II: Add volume control register to DX-1 card. [R. Belmont]

-vtvideo.c): finally fix smooth scrolling (ED084 =1). See DIAG DISK -> 
 VIDEO TEST -> screen 3 (Rainbow driver - SKIP 0). [Bavarese]

-atari400.c - Slightly revised Atari XL cartridge loading so
 that it doesn't crash when loading 8K carts. Confirmed to fix
 MT#05108.  [alegend45]

-dmv: various updates to allow CP/M to boot. [Sandro Ronco]

-apple3: now using the cycle-accurate floppy emulation.
 [R. Belmont]

-corvushd: Fixed prep mode verify drive command. [Mike Naberezny] 
 The verify drive command (0x07) is used by the "format
 check" options of both the Corvus diagnostics program and the SSE
 HardBox configure program.  Previously, format check would halt with
 an error because we did not return a valid response for the verify
 drive command.  Format check now completes successfully and reports no
 bad sectors.

-corvushd: Fixed get drive parameters command. [Mike Naberezny]
 The "read controller code version" option in the Corvus diagnostics
 program now shows the correct version and drive capacity.

-c64: some optimizations [Alex Jackson]
 * read_pla() leaves the PLA outputs packed, instead of using eight
    output parameters to return them
 * flatten nested switch statements in read_memory() and
    write_memory()
 * mos6566: inline bus_r() and various READ_LINE_MEMBERs

-corvushd: Prep mode now supports multiple drives. [Mike Naberezny] 
 This allows the Corvus diagnostics program to format
 any drive.  Previously, the drive id sent in the command to enter prep
 mode was ignored and drive 1 would always be formatted instead.

 -c64 improvement & fix [Alex Jackson]
 * Cache pointers to basic and kernal ROMs at startup (they can be in
    separate ROM regions or a single ROM depending on model) rather
    than branching on every read
 * Moved "ProLogic-DOS Classic" BIOS from c64 to c64c, since it's
    clearly meant for, and only successfully boots on, the latter
    machine

-Colecovision PAL BIOS  [TSM Carmine]

-Fixed Quickload (c64) to allow files packed with Kompressmaster v4.1-3
 from Peter Arndt.  [M.A.S.H.]

-amstrad: added the ability for expansion devices to contain ROMs (as
 some do). added ROMs for DK'Tronics Speech Synthesiser, and both RS232
 interfaces (plus one alternate for the Amstrad interface). split
 Amstrad and Pace serial interfaces into separate devices as they have
 different sized ROM areas. [Barry Rodewald]

-wicat: added additional boot ROMs [Al Kossow, Barry Rodewald]

-abc806: Added video PROMs. [Anders Sandahl]

-Minor Apollo cleanups & removal of no-longer-supported options,
 plus data format fix for systems using a serial terminal.
 [Hans Ostermeyer]

-abc806: Added video PALs. [Anders Sandahl]

-cat.c: fix canon cat breakage from r30715 [Lord Nightmare]

-VTVIDEO: Added new interlaced mode.  Also handle cases where
 undocumented delays / skip lines are poked (SQUINT; VIDEO.PAS). 
 [Bavarese]
