 * Made the cartridge slot on the sg1000m3 driver to no longer be
    mandatory allowing the driver to also be started with media in the
    cardslot.

-cat.c: switched driver to use the new DUART n68681 core [Lord Nightmare]

-cat.c: Fix a silly issue with the video ram mapping on the IAI
 Swyft; now it does visible I/O accesses; the peripherals need to be
 figured out and hooked up still. [Lord Nightmare]

-cat.c: more swyft WIP, still doesn't do very much. Found out it
 uses an ACIA (by looking at the rom code, 'init6850' function is kind
 of a giveaway), plus found where the control register for it lives.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-sms.c: Enabled crosshair display on all screens. This makes
 missil3d playable on the plain '2D' view with scope emulation enabled.
 [Enik Land]

-Renamed IDE8 to XTIDE. [smf]

-dectalk.c: DECtalk DTC-01: updated to use n68681, and to use
 proper device for x2212 NVRAM; updated various comments
 [Lord Nightmare, R.Belmont, Robbert, smf]

-esq5505: Sorted out BIOSes for the SD-1 family: newly dumped 3.0 for
 21-voice, allow selecting 4.02 or 4.10 for 32-voice.
 [Christian Brunschen, R. Belmont]


-a7800.c:  Stored data for 26.7 & 27.7 phase shifts with corrections
 and label for 25.7 values. Made 26.7 (medium) default. Phase shifting
 falls outside the realm of video controls and hope to implement a
 selectable toggle hardware option similar to Donkey Kong TKG02/TKG04.
 [Robert Tuccitto]

-rainbow.c:  RAM OPTION (up to 896K) now emulated; DIP switch
 enhancements; cold / warm boot OK now.  [Bavarese]

Source Changes
--------------

-softbox: Fixed reset. [Mike Naberezny] 

-corvushd: Supported 4 hard disks and usage from within a device. [Curt Coder]

-Added skeleton for IMI 5000H hard disk controller. [Curt Coder, Al Kossow]

-PC driver cleanup: [Dirk Best]
 * Much improved CS4031 emulation, added DMA, interrupt controller,
    timer, RTC directly to the device as sub devices and added the
    generic functions needed for AT compatibility
 * Moved the ct486 driver to its own file, to avoid all the legacy
    stuff in at.c
 * Added support for the IOCHCK signal to the ISA bus, this is used
    instead of directly issuing an NMI to the main CPU
 * Moved ISA device slot definitions to its own file to avoid copy &
    pasting the same list to different drivers
 * Updated MC146818 RTC for devcb2

-Added skeleton device for Mator SHARK (22 MB Winchester hard
 disk for the Commodore PET). [Curt Coder, Mike Naberezny]

-Rename the bridge challenger 3 model 7014 driver from 'abc' to
 'bridgec3', added pcb locations, notes, and better labels.
 [Lord Nightmare]

-famicom: added support for loading/saving BASIC programs
 from/to cassette. wav files supported only. [Fabio Priuli]

-nes.c: improvements and fixes to inputs [Fabio Priuli]
 * simplified input reading
 * moved most Famicom controllers to the expansion port (still
    configurable in the Driver Config menu) because it is more
    accurate and because it allows to use both the FC keyboard and the
    controllers in BASIC games
 * fixed NES paddle emulation which broke some years ago
 * added FC paddle emulation, see Arkanoid and Chase HQ
 * added Hori Twin Adapter with correct P3 & P4 Famicom protocol, see
    e.g. four players games by Technos Japan
   just a cleanup and the whatsnew entry for previous changes...

-nes.c: emulated microphone input for old famicom controller, as
 detected by games (i.e. it only detects voice/no voice, while the
 actual transmission of your voice to the speakers is not emulated). To
 use it in games expecting you to blow or shout in the mic, select the
 "Gamepad (Older Version)" as "P2 Controller" in the Driver
 Configuration submenu, and press "6" when the game requires it.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-nes.c: added emulation of the NES Power Pad controller, to be
 enabled in Controller Port 2 through the Driver Configuration submenu,
 and mapped by default on TY,FGHJ,BN keys for side A layout and
 RTYU,FGHJ,VBNM keys for side B. [Fabio Priuli]

-MEK6800D2 : Added cassette interface, system listed as WORKING [Robbbert]

-nes.c: added emulation of the FC Family Trainer controller, to
 be enabled in Expansion Port through the Driver Configuration submenu,
 and mapped by default like the Power Pad. [Fabio Priuli]

-corvushd: Fixed physical sector calculation. [Mike Naberezny]

-snes.c: simplified input handling and made controller ports 16bits
 wide, since this is the way they are accessed by our code.
 [Fabio Priuli]

-snes.c: simplified input handling, moved the console specific
 inputs to MESS driver and added preliminary Multitap support. Multitap
 has to be enabled in the Driver Configuration menu. The code is
 considered preliminary because some games recognize 4 pads (e.g.
 Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball), other ones recognize 3 pads only (e.g. Super
 Bomberman 3, 4 & 5) and some recognize 2 pads only (e.g. FIFA 96 and
 97). [Fabio Priuli]

-Acorn System 1: added cassette [Robbbert]

-corvushd: Fixed log message. [Mike Naberezny]

-sms: Converted SMS inputs to use slot devices. You now select
 controllers in the Slot Devices menu of the internal UI, not in the
 Driver Configurations anymore. [Enik]

-bml3: split into three variants (bml3, bml3a and bml3b)
 according to floppy disk support. Only bml3a (5.25" disk) is
 considered working. [jedwidz]

-c64: Updated SwiftLink/Turbo232 settings. [Mike Naberezny]

-SNES SA-1 improvements [R. Belmont]
 * S-CPU can properly write to SA-1 registers
 * SA-1 CPU boots properly from its own vectors
 * Interrupt controller implemented
 * Message-passing registers and status flags hooked up

-SNES SA-1: fixed initial SA-1 status and added preliminary SA-1
 to S-CPU IRQ. [R. Belmont]

-gameboy: converted the various LCD types (DMG, MGB, CGB...) to
 be devices. [Fabio Priuli]

-pet: Fixed ROM signatures for Mator Shark hard drive. [Mike Naberezny]

-Fidelz80.c: rename vbc to vbrc, and noted that Fidelity Bridge
 Challenger models VBRC and 7002 are two names for the same thing.
 [Lord Nightmare, Cowering, Kevtris]

-apollo: fixed disk and tape DMA, improved logging [Hans Ostermeyer]

-ibm5170: Emulated the IBM Model F PC/AT 84-key keyboard. [Curt Coder, John Elliott]

-Apollo: fix out-of-bounds framebuffer access crash on OS X [Hans Ostermeyer]

-SNES SA-1 work: [Fabio Priuli, R. Belmont]
 * Initial support for plain SA-1 DMA
 * Fixed incorrect BWRAM banking
 * Fixed SA-1 vectors to not blot out all banks
 * Added S-CPU vector override
 * Fire interrupt for CC type 1; this allows levelling up in SMRPG
    (gfx not correct yet)

-bml3: Add stub variants bml3mk2 (for MB-6891) and bml3mk5 [jedwidz]
 (for MB-6892). For now these behave the same as bml3
 (MB-6890). Refactor disk controllers and kanji ROM as slot devices.
 This allows switching between MP-1802 and MP-1805 disk controllers.
 MP-1805 disk controller now works. Kanji ROM now works. Keyboard
 scanning in 'counter disabled' mode now works.

-imgtool: Add bml3 driver, supporting both single-density (MP-1805  [jedwidz]
 controller) and double-density (MP-1802 controller) disks in D88
 format.

-ibm5160: Emulated the IBM Model F PC/XT 83-key keyboard.
 [Curt Coder, John Elliott]

-PDP1 : Fixed loading of paper tape, Spacewar works again [Robbbert]

-TX0 : Fixed paper tape reader [Robbbert]

-Fixes for building MESS with Visual Studio 2013 preview [smf]

-Vtech1 : fixed i/o error when reading disks. [Robbbert]

-vtech1: fixed i/o ports for vz300, laser310 allowing disk to work. [Robbbert]

-pc1640: Promoted to working with imperfect graphics, the
 extended Paradise EGA-350 video modes are not supported yet.
 [Curt Coder]

-sms.c: Converted TH line callbacks to use write_line.  [Enik Land]

-Ensoniq 16-bit: better A/D parameter handling, allow panel
 device to send new analog data. [Christian Brunschen]

-a7800.c - XM/XBoard POKEY support.  'Bentley Bear - Crystal Quest' &
 'Donkey Kong XM' now work, while maintaining support for original
 library titles, Commando and Ballblazer.  [Robert Tuccitto]

-Mac updates: [R. Belmont]
 * Corrected memory map errors with the SE and Classic
 * Preliminary support for the SE's 68000 processor-direct slot
 * Preliminary support for the Radius Full Page Display card which
    goes in the SE PDS slot

-softbox: Added reset when IEEE-488 IFC is asserted. [Mike Naberezny]
