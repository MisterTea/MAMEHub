   of a device class.
 * AM_SHAREs in a device's internal address map or its default address
   map are now tagmapped as children of that device rather than siblings
   (analogous to how handlers in internal/default address maps are
   scoped).

- Fixed bloom misalignment with HLSL. [MooglyGuy]

-Maygay M1 and MV1 converted to standard i8279 drivers. [J.Wallace]

-added PIC dump to Mega Phoenix [Enricnes (from AUMAP)]

-bladestl.c: simplify rom loading, reduce tagmap lookups [Alex Jackson]

-BFM BD1 and ROC10937 now have proper device line accessors for the
 clock (sclk), reset (por) and data (data). All affected drivers have

 [R. Belmont, based on a patch by Fernando Lemos]

-Netlist: All analysis is now based on an immutable list of terminals.
 The dynamic list now is only used in the "hot" core. This is the base
 for possible further optimizations using multiple lists; e.g. a
 high-low transition list and a low-high transition list. [Couriersud]

-Fix transparency in SDL2.0 code. [Couriersud]

-CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
 * Added full documentation to nemoa
 * nemoa -> nemor1 to follow the new cps1 standard
 * Minor reorder and cleanup

-MC68681: support timer-driven serial channels.  Fixes SC4 fruit
 machine games. [R. Belmont]

-SCSI Port using WRITELINE and DEVCB2. The slot number and SCSI ID are
 separate so you can for example have -harddisk1 as ID 6 and -harddisk
 2 as ID 5. The HLE'd CD & HD have configuration switches to set the
 ID, real emulated hardware will specify the ID using it's own method.
 [smf]

-memory: Stop the watchpoints from messing with the opcode decryption
 [O. Galibert]

-emupal.c: add support for RAM-based palettes with indirect lookups.
 Update various drivers to use it [Alex Jackson]

-chd updates: [MetalliC]
 * Bugfixed byte order for GD-ROM audio tracks so FLAC compression is
    effective

    will update your files to the new SHA1s.

-ioport_array_finder: [Alex Jackson]
 ioport_array_finder is a new device finder template for finding,
 unsurprisingly, an array of ioports. It is mainly intended to help
 handle multiplexed ioports without runtime tagmap lookups in a more
 elegant way than was previously possible.

-TMS34010: Use the CONVSP/CONVDP registers to adjust source and
 destination addresses when window clipping or y-reverse is applied
 [Phil Bennett]

-inder_vid.c - Mirrored TMS34010 RAM at 0x7fc00000 and 0xffc00000. With
 the previous TMS34010 change, this fixes the window clipping issues at
 y=0 [Phil Bennett]

-mb8795: Fix packet sizes [O. Galibert]

 - Made osd_interface base class for OSD and moved initialization for 
   each subsystem in it as virtual calls. [Miodrag Milanovic]
 * Moved midi handling in base class

 fixed fill value, when no battery is found. This allows for loading
 factory formatted sram/nvram from softlist. [Fabio Priuli]

-williams.c: use bankdevs instead of dynamic address map modification.
 Reorganize code and driver state class [Alex Jackson]

-i960.c: Save some additional state [Phil Bennett]

 0xca; 0xc9 = 0xcb as documented at OS 2 Museum. [Bavarese]

-rx50_dsk.h/c: Rainbow specific; The RX50 _disk drive_ was used in
 different architectures.  Floppy format used by Rainbow-100 and -190.
 Track layout (post-amble, some positions) yet unverified. Currently
 only raw 400 K disk dumps are supported (*.img).  [Bavarese]

-upd765: implement scan data and read track [Carl] 
 fail command when drive not ready and check ready before command (verified on real
 hardware) stop polling when first byte of command sent (verified)

-SDL: fix 0.153 regression where user GLSL shaders didn't work.
 [R. Belmont]

-SDL: Fix shaders for games that output indexed16 (e.g. pacman).
 [R. Belmont]

-namcos1.c: Completely rewrote the emulation of the CUS117 MMU. The MMU
 is no longer emulated by modifying address maps at runtime, an
 operation which has become excessively slow as the core memory system
 has accumulated features and complexity over the years. Instead, the
 MMU is now a device which works on similar principles to the
 address_map_bank_device. The recent multisession regression is fixed,
 all games in the driver should now run substantially faster, and most
 importantly the driver code is now much cleaner and easier to
 understand. [Alex Jackson]

-chihiro.c:  [f205v]
 * Added exact release dates, GDX info and descriptions for all known
    existing games/releases not yet secured or dumped

    GDX-0024A

-triforce.c:  [f205v]
 * Added exact release dates, GDT info and descriptions for all known
    existing games/releases not yet secured or dumped
 * Added v5 CHDs redumps for: GDT-0002, GDT-0013E, GDT-0015

-SDL: fix -prescale 0.153 regression. [R. Belmont]

-fixed -j compilation with VS2013 [Oliver Stöneberg]

-atahle: Added CS1 active status register. [Curt Coder]

-SDL: Always supply screen size uniforms to GLSL shaders, and fix bug
 with X multihead. [R. Belmont]

-seta.c: Verify clocks and fix refresh rate for daioh. [trap15]

-m68040: fbcc dasm fixes [O. Galibert]

-Recreated yet again the CHDs from r30949 (no new sets) which all had
 different SHA1 hashes due to bugfixes with CHDMAN since 0.153 release.
 [f205v]

-nscsi_cd: I told'ya, there's no disk in the drive [O. Galibert]

-Updated m72.c with a Guru-readme for Ninja Spirit.  Changed labels
where appropriate to match information and added PALs/PROMs.  [Guru]

-NeoGeo (multi)slot work [S. Smith, David Haywood]
 * converted all protection types to be MAME devices
 * created cartridge (slot) device types for each type of cartridge
   containing the above protection devices
 * made the 'neogeo' set emulate a 6-slot MVS system allowing for
   multiple cartridges to be mounted, for example
   "mame64 neogeo -cart1 mslug -cart2 mslugx -cart3 mslug3"
   is the command-line syntax to launch an MVS unit with 3 Metal
   Slug games installed.
    - many of the hacks / bootlegs won't work in multi-slot setups,
      this is true to hardware
    - some carts (kof95, kof2002 for example) can block recognition
      of carts in higher slots if the NVRAM isn't already initialized.
      this appears to be true to original hardware because the kof95h
      set fixes this issue, powering off/on the system fixes it.
    - sound banking isn't 100% correctly handled so the odd game may
      fail with the slot system (trally) but regular loading still
      works
    - the slot / multislot support makes use of the Software Lists
      rather than the internal sets, please ensure the correct softlist
      XML file is present in your hash folder

-i86.c: 0x60 shadow omitted in previous patch. Needed for DOS 2.  [Bavarese]

-Add width and endianness attributes to data areas in software lists.
 Update neogeo.xml and megadriv.xml to take advantage of them. [Alex Jackson]

-m6502: remove expensive and unused attotime precalculation at start of
 each timeslice [Alex Jackson]

-funworld.c:  Inserted some more switches, Saloon now boots, and
 service mode is mostly working.  Added default nvram to jolycrdb, game
 seems to work now.  [Peter Ferrie]

-sh2: fix and enable memory system bypass for SH-1 & SH-2 DRC.
 [R. Belmont]

-schedule.c: make yield() actually yield again, rather than be a
 synonym for spin() [Alex Jackson]

-schedule.c: rebuild_execute_list() after loading a savestate to ensure
 the order of execution remains consistent. Fixes 0.153 savestate
 regressions in various drivers [Alex Jackson]

-nec v25: Implement programmable clock divider via
 execute_clocks_to_cycles() instead of set_clock_scale(). Properly
 restore the clock divider on state load [Alex Jackson]

-Cool Pool: added 2nd button and button labels [Gamez Fan]

-Document recent measurements done on the AY8910. [Couriersud]
