Source Changes
--------------
-Added NVRAMs for devices in software item named folder
 [Miodrag Milanovic]

-Changed keycus into a device and moved it into it's own file, only 3
 parameters are saved instead of 64k. Changed I/O to 16 bits & uses
 memory maps instead of installing at runtime. Simplified digital
 player 3 inputs that are hooked up to dac inputs. [smf]

-diserial: Added methods for clocking the receiver/transmitter outside
 of the timers. [Curt Coder]

-Removes more MAME anonymous timers. [Andrew Gardner]

-Added DIP switch location to Namco System 11 & 12, also removed unused
 test dip switches. [smf]

-HLSL changes: [MooglyGuy]
 * Upped vertex buffer size to 64k verts, fixes assert in starwars and
    alphaone, please include the printed error message in any
    subsequent encounterings of the assert.
 * Improved vector rendering (beam width 1.5 suggested)
 * Ducked raster bloom default to 0.225 to reduce washout

-i386dasm.c  [Peter Ferrie]
 * fix improper signed display in some opcode parameters

-Register the device post load after the devices are started, in case
 starting the device causes something (like sound_stream) to register
 it's own post load [smf]

-audit.c: Fixed software list chd verification.  [qmc2]

-mazerbla.c: add notes about the game pcbs [Lord Nightmare, Quarterarcade]

-replace first rom of Ambush with a fresh dump, marked the old set as
 likely hacked [Ricky2001 (from AUMAP)]

-zn.c: added YMZ280 sound emulation to hvnsgate [smf, hap]

-m6800: Resolved out_sc2_func for M6808/HD6301/HD63701 variants.
 [Curt Coder]

-ksys573: Externalize the digital board [O. Galibert]

-Added a check for a bus error when fetching an instruction, the bus
 error condition is cleared before the fetch so bus errors in the
 debugger don't cause an exception to be triggered. [smf]

-m6502: Redo the prefetch and reset the state on debugger PC change
 [O. Galibert]

-savquest.c: added HASP emulator; marked BIOS as bad dump because it's
 incomplete [Peter Ferrie]

-z80dart: Merged in uPD7201 and modernized the interface. [Curt Coder]

-emuopts.c: Added a new option -statename which allows to specify the
 location of state saving, relative to -state_directory (whose usage
 remains unchanged). Syntax is basically the same as snapname, allowing
 for the  / character as path separator, %g as the driver name, and
 %d_[media] as the image name mounted in the "media" device.

 For example, using -statename foo/%g when running "mame wrally" will
 store save states into the folder sta/foo/wrally/ ; using -statename
 %g/%d_cart when running "mess nes -cart smb" will store save states
 into the folder sta/nes/smb/ ; using -statename %g/%d_cdrm when
 running "mess pce -cart cdsys -cdrm draculax" will store save states
 into sta/pce/draculax/ Specifying a media switch which is not
 available (e.g. %d_cdrm in a c64) or a media switch where no image is
 mounted (e.g. %d_cdrm in pce while playing a hucard game) will revert
 the option to its default value %g and save states will be stored in
 sta/*gamename*/ as in previous versions. [Fabio Priuli]

-msm5205.c: modernized the device. [Fabio Priuli]

-Added ds2401 rom loading to digital i/o board, rather than specifying
 it in each game. Fixes Mambo A Go-Go booting. [smf]

-snes_snd: modernized the SNES sound device [Fabio Priuli]

-tms6100: modernized theTMS6100 and M58819 devices. [Osso]

-Moved default card config, device inputs and clock off the slot
 interface so they can be specified for all cards [smf]

-Added support for machine config fragments that are applied when the
 cart is loaded, converted NCR 53C7xx to devcb2 as an example [smf]

-Converted NCR5380N to devcb2 [smf]

-Converted NCR5390 to devcb2 & use MCFG_DEVICE_CLOCK to set SCSI chip
 clock [smf]

-pcshare: make all the common pc hardware in various pc based drivers
 inherit from pcat_base_state [Carl]

-Adds the Image menu to the QT debugger's main window. This allows the
 user to mount disk/c images from the UI. [Andrew Gardner]

-uiimage.c: when creating a new file from the File Manager, require the
 user to enter an extension too [Fabio Priuli]

-modernized the RP5H01 device [Osso]

-Converted the Konami System 573 Security Cassettes to use slots. The
 current setting is no longer saved, so the default cassette is "game".
 Some games have additional I/O connected via the security cassette,
 which is now hooked up when the cassette is loaded instead of patched
 directly into the memory map. If the game has a separate "install"
 cassette then you need to select this and hard reset (shift+F3 or
 select reset from the slot menu) before it will let you install from
 the CD. [smf]

-modernized the MB14241 and MathBox devices. [Osso]

-inpttype.h: Use O1 instead of O0 on the critical function
 [Hans Ostermeyer]

-Fixed clipping of device address maps if the size of the map caused
 the end address to wrap. Added a proof of concept implementation of a
 address map bank device, which allows you to bank memory maps. Hooked
 it up to Taito GNET as an example [smf]

-Finished converting Taito GNET to use address maps instead of
 installing at run time [smf]

-Modernized the geebee and warpwarp sound devices [Osso]

-finished modernizing gp9001 [smf]

-modernized the MM58274C RTC device. [Fabio Priuli]

-Allow AM_NOP in device address maps, there may be others that should
 be allowed. [smf]

-Created a PCCARD slot and Linear Flash Card for System 573. Uses
 bankdev.c for banking the onboard flash chips and the pccard slots.
 This adds an extra two calls to the memory system & intelfsh.c already
 called the memory system for accessing the data. [smf]

-Split rf5c296 and ata flash functionality from taitogn.c into their
 own devices. The pccard slot has had to revert to use memory handlers
 instead of device maps for the moment [smf]

-modernized Kaneko Pandora device. [Osso]

-modernized the TMS9927 device [Fabio Priuli]

-Modernized the PIT8253 device. [Fabio Priuli]

-modernized speaker device. [Fabio Priuli]

-modernized Taito I/O devices. [Osso]

-Roms renamed for set gtmrusa to match actual labels.  [Porchy]

-Started to split ide hd from ide controller [smf]

-firebeat: split midi keyboard to separate device [Carl]

-Modernized Flower sound device. [Osso]

-Added better .ini defaults for HLSL, and hooked up bloom sliders. [MooglyGuy]

-Added macros for read/write delegates. [Curt Coder]

-QT Debugger: WIP for a new breakpoints window. [Andrew Gardner]

-Modernized nmk112 device. [Osso]

-Modernized Namco I/O devices (56xx, 58xx, 59xx) [Osso, Fabio Priuli]

-naomi video: Pretend-modernize the powervr2 [O. Galibert]

-powervr2: Some register groups are obviously 32 bits, so make them so [O. Galibert]

-naomi: Better IRQ isolation [O. Galibert]

-naomig1: Make the dma cpu-independant [O. Galibert]

-First pass at tidying up ide interface. It no longer tries to force
 everything to act as a PC. A copy of the VIA VT83C461 datasheet would
 be useful to remove some of the hacks added to make the games using it
 work again. [smf]

-Modernize adc1038 and adc12138 devices. [Osso]

-Added USE_SIMD flag to RSP headers and began converting some opcodes
 to use SSE* intrinsics. Current plan is to target SSSE3-capable
 hardware (Core2 and up), with the resulting speedup theorized to be on
 the order of 5-10x when conversion is complete, though this applies
 only to situations where the emulation is heavily bottlenecked by the
 RSP. [MooglyGuy]

-nmk16.c: raphero sound improvements [trap15]

-Added SIMD code for the rest of the RSP vector load instructions [MooglyGuy]

-Improved Dragon World II protection routines [iq_132]

-Verified pacuman gfx roms [elnaib and Santy14]

  incorrectly writing an NVRAM file.  (Fabio Priuli)
- 05139: [Color Palette): ryorioh: Wrong Colors (Angelo Salese)
- 05179: [Interface] -burnin option not functioning  (Fabio Priuli)
  


Source Changes
--------------
-QT Debugger fixes:
 * New memory windows start focused on the active CPU.
 * Opening a utility window, closing it, and stepping no longer
    re-opens the window. [Andrew Gardner]

-shangha3.c: Added dipswitch locations to Shanghai III, Hebereke no
 Ponpoon and Blocken. [Brian Troha]

-m6502: Seriously untested multi-dispatch-table support [O. Galibert]

-coolridr: work around miscompile on newer versions of Clang

 [R. Belmont, Guru, Charles MacDonald]

-aristmk4.c:  [Heihachi73]
 * Added Caribbean Gold (working), cleaned up comments and EPROM part
   numbers for a handful of games. Caribbean Gold needs some trivial
   input changes, as currently it has a logic door error on boot, however
   if you hit the coin input the error goes away and allows you to key in
   to perform a memory reset and finally coin up.

 * Also, Caribbean Gold 2 [cgold2] now has passable graphics, by using
   two of cgold's graphics ROMs (cgold u8 and u9 -> cgold2 u20 and u45)
   the game is now playable instead of a garbled mess (there are only a
   few tiles which differ between both games).

 * Promoted Caribbean Gold II and Fortune Hunter (and clone) to working -
   these had been working ever since eforest and arcwins were promoted
   but the flags were never removed.

 significantly.
 [digshadow, Sarayan, Lord Nightmare]

-M740: Correct disassembly for seb x,A/clb x,A [R. Belmont]

-Treat x & y coordinates as 11 bit signed on dots, lines & rectangles.
 This fixes sprites in Zaynac X Zaynac (fc version) in MESS [smf]

-QT Debugger: The memory view chunk size radio now reports proper
 sizes. Fixed "ignore" command reporting incorrect invalid CPUs. Fixed
 crazy code responsible for opcodes' crc32s in the comments system
 (what was I thinking back then?). [Andrew Gardner]

-315_5124.c: Small improvements to the palettes.  [Enik Land]

-i960: Add cvtilr needed by Zero Gunner. [R. Belmont]

-tms5220.c: Extremely minor fix for Speak External based on the 5220c
 and 5200 decaps, and some small documentation updates.
 [Lord Nightmare, digshadow]

-gaplus.c: Corrected some issues between Galaga 3 & Gaplus sets.
 [Brian Troha]

 textures being displayed in a few games and the pse bios v2.2. [smf]

-psxgpu_device::update_screen clears the border area. [smf]

-fixed GTE A1/A1/A3 flag calculation when the result exceeds the
 maximum bounds. GPF & DPCT work with all values of sf & lm [smf]

-namcos23: Update hardware readme [Guru]

-drawd3d.c - Fixes performance issues with YIQ enabled and
 prescale_x/prescale_y changes no longer impacts colors.
 [Just Desserts, Robert Tuccitto]

-Fixed GTE GPL & DCPL opcodes by porting over some changes from an old
 tree [smf]

-Added default NVRAM to royalcrdp, allowing to boot the game, and
  promoted to working state. [Peter Ferrie]

-Added default NVRAM to magicrd2b and magicrd2c, allowing to boot both
  games, and promoted to working state. [Peter Ferrie, Roberto Fresca]

-TMS5100 and 5200 series: document the decapping and verification of
 chirp tables for the tms5100, tms5200, tms5220, and tms5220c.
 The LPC tables are not verified yet. [digshadow, Lord Nightmare]

Source Changes
--------------
-srcclean now processes XML & C comments the same, so they can be
 indented but within the comment itself spaces are used. [smf]

-remove extraneous line continuation characters followed by a blank
 line and blank lines that follow an opening brace in c files. [smf]

-i8244.c: Added a device implementation for the i8244/i8245. 
 [Wilbert Pol]

-diimage: allow image devices to skip core fopen() of the image's
 filename and handle themselves in call_load() [R. Belmont]

-uimain.c: use slot interface names for filling current values in slot
 menu, because using command line options produces garbage at least on
 OS10.6.8. [Fabio Priuli]

-subsino.c: hopper emulation in stisub, smoto and clones [Luca Elia]

-DSP16: Additional opcodes & disassembly fixes.  [Andrew Gardner]

-n68681: fixed trashing of the serial parameters when ACR is updated.
 [R. Belmont]

-MIDI core updates: [R. Belmont]
  * Add MIDI in and out ports as image device types

    serial bitstream

-d3dhlsl.c: Made HLSL switchable at runtime, Ctrl+Alt+F5. [MooglyGuy]

-MIDI: allow input port to work without a connected real device [R. Belmont]

-First pass on MIDI out support [R. Belmont]

-DSP16 : Additional opcodes.  [Andrew Gardner]

-Hooked up lamps in Virtua Racing.  [SailorSat]

-Added a preliminary boolean flag to MC6845 interface structure: "show
 border area". If true, it will show the whole video area including
 border + blanking areas. [Angelo Salese]

-DSP16: The PC moves on from potentially all used opcodes now. 
 [Andrew Gardner]

-MIDI: Fixed several bugs and bumped the input buffer sizes [R. Belmont]

  * In instruction with 6bit immediate data, this data is signed value.
    It would be better to show this sign because it is confusing to
    see for example 0x3F which actually means -1 (32bit immed data are
    not confusing as that big values are easy to recognize).

-Bonne Chance!: Worked complete inputs from the scratch. Promoted to
 working. Added some notes. [Roberto Fresca]

-Bonne Chance!: Added proper palette. Now the game seems to get
 accurate colors. Also added some descriptive notes and instructions
 for the service mode. [Roberto Fresca]

-Added many PAL10L8's for balsente.c games.  [Kevin Eshbach]

-Modernised the R3000 core: [Phil Bennett]
  * The following variants are supported: R3041, R3051, R3052, R3071
    and R3081
  * Endianness is now specified by MCFG_R3000_ENDIANNESS() (default is
    big-endian)
  * Removed configuration struct. Cache sizes and FPU availability are
    now determined from the CPU type
  * Added state saving
  * Added BrCond input callbacks

-CPS-2 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Fixed 3 labels in sfa2u
  * Reordered sfz2alj set

-psx: change the rendering back to quads as less people complained about the
 old graphical issues compares to the new ones [smf]
